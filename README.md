This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. She's pretty cool.

## About

> "A brilliantly smart girl, extremely hot, fun to be with. Can make just about anyone laugh. Inclined to psychopathic tendencies, but only towards people(or things) that deserve it. Very inquisitive by nature, and can't stand not knowing the answer to something. People are always jealous of a Maddy, mostly because they're against pretty people/smart people, or they just wish they were as cool as a Maddy." - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=maddy
